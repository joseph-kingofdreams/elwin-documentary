                    We’re taking our curiosity across America, following the
                    lives of Underground Railroad Operators. The places they
                    lived. The people they met. The reasons for their burning
                    desire to act on their convictions. We will walk where they
                    walked, eat where they ate, and talk to the modern experts
                    of these; the Agents of the Underground Railroad
